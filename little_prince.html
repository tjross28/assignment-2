        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
        I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.
        <span class="highlight">
            It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.
        </span>
        In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled
        in the wind, and I said to myself:
        <span class="quote">
            "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible…"
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
        <span class="quote">
            "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower—the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep…"
        </span>
        And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame
        that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind….
